We will create a simple Streamlit app - with 2 colum layout.

1. Title banner on the top "Reinforcement Learning for Predictive Maintenance".
2. Two columns or panes: 30%-70%. Left column - Prussian blue RGB (0,49, 82) for and right pane in pale grey (hex F5,F5,F5)
3. The left pane must be static with all the features and buttons
4. The right pane must be scrollable for the graphs etc.
5. Use neat straight lines for the areas and 11 size font for button
6. I have the functionality ready as Python Notebook. I want this UI to visualize my work. It must by Python compatible.
I should be able to swap the dummy functions mentioned below with my real functions
9. Left pane 30% width has the following features:
- Button "Select milling-data file": Browse button to open see files and open one. As soon as file opens - right pane shows the visualization.
Use dummy function as placeholder Dummy_Visualization()
Button. "Train a REINFORCE model": use the above traiing data file and train a save a model. Use dummy function as placeholder Dummy_REINFORCE().
For now show progress bar below this button.
- Button. "Train a REINFORCE model with Attention mechanism": Use dummy function as placeholder Dummy_REINFORCE_AM(). Add progress bar like above
Button "Select milling-data file for evaluation". Load evaluation file and show visualzaiton using samee function Dummy_Visualization()
Button "Evaluate Test pre-trained model". Allow pickgin the saved model and run Dummy_Evaluate().
Will evaluate and show performance metrics and visualization plots in the right pane
